# AssignmnetTracker
Python application that tracks assignments and allows them to be quired, filtered, edited, and/or deleted. Makes use of Pandas data-frame and a toy gui library inherited from tkinter (I did not write breezypythongui). This application was a final project for an introduction to programming course in Python.
